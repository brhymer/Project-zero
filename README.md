Items in {curly brackets} indicate nice-to-haves.

## MVP:

This will be a short adventure game that cosmetically resembles NES classic The Legend of Zelda {using sprites for on-screen objects}.

The player will take control of a character and move it around a number of pre-rendered maps.

The player will be able to collect items, interact with NPCs, {view an inventory screen, use items} and battle enemies.
